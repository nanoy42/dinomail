## Evolution of DinoMail

### Bug fixes

DinoMail is obviously opened to any bug reports and we **will** fix bugs.

### API features

API does not offer as much control as the graphical interface. We **will** implement, on demand, any feature that is already in DinoMail but not on the API.

### New features

DinoMail is not closed to new features. However, we want DinoMail to stay simple, lightweight, os and softwares independent. Hence

  * DinoMail **will not** implement any reading message features (webmail)
  * DinoMail **may** implement test connections to the mail server
  * DinoMail **will not** directly modify configuration files or interact with mail softwares
  * DinoMail **may** help generating configuration files
